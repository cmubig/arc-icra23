# Call for Papers

<p>The 2nd Workshop on <a href="https://learn-to-race.org/workshop-ai4ad-ijcai2022/" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence for Autonomous Driving</a> (AI4AD) is co-located with the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2022), to be held on 23 July 2022 (hybrid).</p>

While there have been significant advances in vehicle autonomy (e.g., perception, trajectory forecasting, planning and control, etc.), it is of paramount importance for autonomous systems to adhere to safety specifications, as any safety infraction in urban and highway driving, or high-speed racing could lead to catastrophic failures. Given this inherent tension between safety and performance, we introduce a new simulation environment in autonomous racing as a particularly challenging proving ground for safe learning algorithms.<br>

We envision this workshop bringing together researchers and industry practitioners from different AI subfields to work towards safer and more robust autonomous technology. We encourage participants to take part in the Challenge by competing for top leaderboard positions, to submit articles for review, and to engage with us at IJCAI 2022.

## Workshop Publication Topics

We are accepting papers in the following broad areas of safe vehicle autonomy, including (but not limited to):

- Safe reinforcement learning, safe exploration, constrained reinforcement learning
- Safe learning approaches inspired by control theory, e.g., control barrier function, Lyapunov method, reachability analysis
- Safety verification, Certifying learning-based control under dynamical uncertainty, Dependability analysis for learning-based systems
- Robustness to out-of-distribution road scenes
- Learning vehicle dynamics at high-speeds and in unstable regimes
- Vision-based perception and scene understanding for autonomous driving; Representation learning
- Transfer learning from simulation to real-world; Meta-learning; Domain Adaptation;
- End-to-end and real-time autonomous driving systems
- Novel automotive sensors and their applications
- Behavior prediction of pedestrians, vehicles, and animals
- Self/semi/weakly-supervised learning, domain adaptation for autonomous driving
- Multi-task learning in autonomous driving
- Explainability in autonomous driving
- Learning to drive via imitation learning
- Uncertainty propagation through autonomous driving pipelines
- Planning and control for autonomous driving
- Cooperative and competitive multi-agent systems
- Visual grounding and its application to autonomous driving
- Visual-language navigation for self-driving
- Audio-visual navigation for self-driving
- Auditory Perception (detection, tracking, segmentation, motion estimation, etc)
- Brain-inspired autonomous control systems
- Human factors in autonomous driving
- AI ethics in autonomous driving
- Autonomous driving datasets
- Evaluation and metrics of autonomous driving tasks
- Connected autonomous driving and vehicle-to-vehicle communication
- Autonomous driving for traffic management and emission reduction

## Challenge Participation

To further increase workshop engagement, we propose a new autonomous driving challenge to stimulate interdisciplinary autonomous driving research and help advance state-of-the-art on a practical benchmark. The challenge will be based on the Learn-to-Race Autonomous Racing Framework: <a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/learn-to-race-autonomous-racing-virtual-challenge" target="_blank">https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/learn-to-race-autonomous-racing-virtual-challenge</a>

The main goal of the challenge in this AI4AD workshop is to evaluate the joint safety, performance, and generalization capabilities of perception and control algorithms, in autonomous driving. Analogous to racing being used to test cutting-edge vehicle technology, we envision racing to serve as a particularly challenging proving ground for safe learning algorithms as: (i) vehicles are required to drive at their physical limits, with barely any margin for safety, where any infraction could lead to catastrophic failure; (ii) autonomous agents are required to make sub-second decisions, in fast-changing environments; and (iii) visual perception pipelines must remain robust to distribution shifts, novel road features, and other obstacles, in order to facilitate cross-domain safety and performance

## Submission Guidelines

> Submission deadline: <b>13 May 2022 at 23:59, Central European Time (CET)</b><br>
